                        Hello, My name is Braden you've found my website! For much of my 
                        life, I assumed that programming was something that only people 
                        who loved video games were interested in. When I ended up taking 
                        an introductory programming class in college (as a part of a Math 
                        degree), I quickly becamed hooked on the joys of coding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I currently work as a Software Engineer and AI specialist. I 
                        love many different forms and facets of programming, from web 
                        development to embedded software, but I've recently been 
                        enjoying the opportunities to leverage my mathematical and 
                        statistical knowledge in conjunction with code through machine
                        learning and AI related projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for the moniker "The Greengo", it's just a simple play on the
                        spanish term "gringo" and my favorite color green. It's been my 
                        tag/username on several platforms for years, so if you run across
                        another "the greengo" account out in the internet, it might just 
                        be me.
